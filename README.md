<h1>AI-DRIVEN PUBLIC HEALTHCARE CHATBOT FOR DISEASE AWARENESS  </h1>
<h2>Description:</h2>
Create a multilingual AI chatbot to educate rural and semi-urban populations about preventive healthcare, disease symptoms, and vaccination schedules. The chatbot should integrate with government health databases and provide real-time alerts for outbreaks.
